## üåü Overview

KnowZ facilitates peer-to-peer skill exchange by matching users based on their teaching abilities and learning goals. The platform uses a graph database to efficiently find complementary skill relationships between users, enabling a swipe-based matching system similar to dating apps. Users can find someone who knows what they want to learn, and in return, they can teach skills they've mastered.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via flask-jwt-extended
- **Database**: ArangoDB (graph database)
- **API**: RESTful architecture
- **Security**: Password hashing via Werkzeug
- **Environment**: Python 3.8+

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Routing**: React Router

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

KnowZ uses a graph database (ArangoDB) to model the relationships between users and skills:

- **Vertices**:
  - Users
  - Skills

- **Edges**:
  - has_skill (User ‚Üí Skill): Skills a user can teach
  - wants_to_learn (User ‚Üí Skill): Skills a user wants to learn

This graph structure enables efficient querying for potential matches, finding users whose teaching skills align with others' learning goals.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (16.x or higher)
- Python 3.8+
- ArangoDB 3.7+
- Git

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Bhatt/knowZ.git](https://github.com/BhattAnsh/KnowZ.git)
   cd knowz
   ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   cd api
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   ARANGO_URL=http://localhost:8529
   ARANGO_DB_NAME=skillswap
   ARANGO_USERNAME=root
   ARANGO_PASSWORD=your_password
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   FLASK_ENV=development
   PORT=8088
   ```

5. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install NPM dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Database Setup

1. Install and start ArangoDB following the [official documentation](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/stable/getting-started-installation.html)

2. Create a database named `skillswap` (or match your ARANGO_DB_NAME environment variable)

3. The application will automatically set up collections and indexes on first run

## üí° Usage

1. **Registration**: Create an account with your username, email, and password. Add your initial teaching skills and learning goals.

2. **Profile Setup**: Fill in your profile with additional teaching skills and learning goals.

3. **Find Matches**: Browse potential matches based on skill compatibility.

4. **Connect**: Swipe right on users you're interested in learning from or teaching. When there's mutual interest, it's a match!

5. **Communicate**: Message your matches to arrange knowledge-sharing sessions.
